            <article>I go by the name Sandra Mensah.Aged 24years.First born of my parents.A christian by religion.Am a graduate with bsc degree in Physician Assistantship, currrently unemployed waiting to write my license exam. Love spending time with friends but i hardly make new friends though cux i love to keep my circle small, so i feel the important thing is to rather keep the few ones i have made for long. Favourite artist is sarkodie.I love everything about him especially his personality. Currently undergoing a training in developing website.I am partaking in it cux i wanna learn something  new outside my field of study and profession cux who knows, i might have an interest in it and divert from the health sector.THANK YOU!
